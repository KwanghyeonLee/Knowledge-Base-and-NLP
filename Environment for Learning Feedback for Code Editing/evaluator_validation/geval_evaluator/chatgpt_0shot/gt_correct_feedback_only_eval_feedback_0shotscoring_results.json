However, we must select at least one number and we have the option to remove one number from the sequence (although it is not required to remove any).\nFor example, let's say we have the sequence 10, -4, 3, 1, 5, 6, -35, 12, 21, -1. The answer, when no numbers are removed, would be 33 (which is the sum of 12 and 21).\nIf we decide to remove -35, the sequence becomes 10, -4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 12, 21, -1, and the answer would then be 54 (which is the sum of 10, -4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 12, and 21).\n - output format: Print the answer on the first line.\n - input format: The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100,000), and the second line contains a sequence of n integers. Each integer is greater than or equal to -1,000 and less than or equal to 1,000.\nIncorrect code:\n```python\nN = int(input())\ndata = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))\n\nLD = [0 for _ in range(N)]\nRD = [0 for _ in range(N)]\n\nLD[0] = data[0]\nRD[N-1] = data[N-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, N):\n    LD[i] = max(data[i], LD[i-1] + data[i])\n\nfor i in range(N-2, -1, -1):\n    RD[i] = max(data[i], RD[i+1] + data[i])\n\nmax_sum = 0\nfor i in range(1, N-2):\n    max_sum = max(max_sum, LD[i-1] + RD[i+1])\nprint(max_sum)\n```\nFeedback:Your current logic for calculating the maximum sum is incorrect because you are missing the case where no numbers are removed. Additionally, your loop range for the last loop is incorrect, as it should be from 1 to N-1 instead of 1 to N-2.\n\nIs_Correct_Feedback:",

If an attempt is made to move it outside, the command should be ignored and no output should be made.\n - output format: Output the number written on the upper face of the dice every time it is moved. If you try to move it outside, you should ignore the command and not output anything.\n - input format: The first line contains the vertical size of the map N, the horizontal size of the map M (1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 20), the coordinates x and y where the dice is placed (0 \u2264 x \u2264 N-1, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 M-1), and the number of commands K (1 \u2264 K \u2264 1,000).\nFrom the second line, N lines indicate the numbers written on the map from the north to the south. Each line is given from west to east. The number written on the square where the dice is placed is always 0. The numbers written on each square of the map are natural numbers less than 10 or 0.\nThe last line contains the sequence of commands to move the dice. East is given as 1, west as 2, north as 3, and south as 4.\nIncorrect code:\n```python\nimport sys; input = sys.stdin.readline\n\ndef turn(dir):\n    a, b, c, d, e, f = dice[0], dice[1], dice[2], dice[3], dice[4], dice[5]\n    if dir == 1: \n        dice[0], dice[1], dice[2], dice[3], dice[4], dice[5] = d, b, a, f, e, c\n\n    elif dir == 2: \n        dice[0], dice[1], dice[2], dice[3], dice[4], dice[5] = c, b, f, a, e, d\n\n    elif dir == 3: \n        dice[0], dice[1], dice[2], dice[3], dice[4], dice[5] = e, a, c, d, f, b\n\n    else:\n        dice[0], dice[1], dice[2], dice[3], dice[4], dice[5] = b, f, c, d, a, e\n\n\nN, M, x, y, K = map(int, input().split())\nmaps = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\ndirection = list(map(int, input().split()))\ndice = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndx = [0, 0, -1, 1]\ndy = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n\nnx, ny = x, y\nfor d in direction:\n    nx += dx[d-1]\n    ny += dy[d-1]\n    if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < M:\n        turn(d)\n        if maps[nx][ny] == 0:\n            maps[nx][ny] = dice[-1]\n        else:\n            dice[-1] = maps[nx][ny]\n            maps[nx][ny] = 0\n\n    print(dice[0])\n```\nFeedback:Your code is almost correct, but you need to add a check to ensure that the dice doesn't move outside of the map, and if it does, you should ignore the command and continue to the next one.\n\nIs_Correct_Feedback:",

The status of the space consists of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, each having the following meanings:\n\n0: Empty space\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: Size of a fish in the space\n9: Position of the baby shark\n\nThere is only one baby shark in the space.\nIncorrect code:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport sys\n\nN = int(input())\ndy = [-1, 0, 0, 1]\ndx = [0, -1, 1, 0]\n\nboard = []\nfor _ in range(N):\n    board.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\ndef inrange(y, x):\n    if y < 0 or y >= N or x < 0 or x >= N:\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef bfs(sy, sx, shark_size):\n    q = deque([(sy, sx, 0)])\n    stack = []\n    board[sy][sx] = 0\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n    while q:\n        y, x, cnt = q.popleft()\n        visited[y][x] = True\n        for i in range(4):\n            ny, nx = y + dy[i], x + dx[i]\n            if not inrange(ny, nx) or visited[ny][nx]:\n                continue\n            if shark_size < board[ny][nx]:\n                continue\n            if board[ny][nx] != 0 and shark_size > board[ny][nx]:\n                stack.append((cnt, ny, nx))\n            q.append((ny, nx, cnt + 1))\n    stack.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2]))\n    if not stack:\n        return (-1, -1, -1)\n    return stack[0]\n\nsy, sx = -1, -1\nfor y in range(N):\n    for x in range(N):\n        if board[y][x] == 9:\n            sy, sx = y, x\n\nanswer = 0\nsize = 2\nate = 0\nwhile True:\n    cnt, y, x = bfs(sy, sx, size)\n\n    if cnt == -1:\n        break\n    ate += 1\n    answer += cnt + 1\n    if ate == size:\n        size += 1\n        ate = 0\n    sy, sx = y, x\n\nprint(answer)\n```\nFeedback:1. Your logic for determining the movement of the baby shark is incorrect, as you are not considering the condition where the baby shark can pass through cells with fish of the same size.\n2. You are not correctly updating the board after the baby shark eats a fish, as you are setting the cell to 0 instead of the size of the shark.\n3. You need to break the while loop when the baby shark cannot eat any more fish.\n4. Instead of using a stack to store candidate moves, you can directly update the result, shark size, and number of fish ate variables.\n5. The variables \"answer\" and \"ate\" are unnecessary and can be removed.\n6. The directions in the dy and dx variables are incorrect and need to be adjusted.\n7. The if condition for checking if the shark can eat a fish is incorrect, as you are comparing the size of the shark with the size of the fish instead of checking if the fish is smaller than the shark.\n8. The \"visited\" list is unnecessary and can be removed, as you can directly update the board to mark visited cells.\n9. You need to update the board after each move to mark the current cell as empty.\n\nIs_Correct_Feedback:",

For example, if the number written on the 3rd cell is 3, Jaehwan can jump to either the 4th, 5th, or 6th cell.\n\nJaehwan is currently at the far left end of the maze and wants to reach the far right end. Write a program to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end. If it is impossible to reach the far right end, output -1.\n - output format: Prints the minimum number of jumps that Jaehwan needs to take to reach the far right end, or -1 if it is not possible to reach the far right end.\n - input format: The first line contains an integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1,000). \nThe second line contains N integers Ai (0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 100).\nIncorrect code:\n```python\nn=int(input())\ndataLst=list(map(int,input().split()))\n\ntotal=0\nindex=0\nwhile index<=n:\n    total=dataLst[index]\n    index+=dataLst[index]\n\n\nprint(total)\n```\nFeedback:Your current logic is incorrect because you are not properly updating the index in your while loop, and you also need to consider the case where it is impossible to reach the far right end by checking the value of dp[n-1].\n\nIs_Correct_Feedback:",

        "description": "There is a commander in a military unit consisting of n soldiers numbered from 1 to n. The commander wants to divide the n soldiers into multiple special forces for future battles. To increase cohesion and morale, each special force is composed of consecutive soldiers with numbers in the form of {i, i+1, ..., i+k}.\n\nThe combat power of each soldier i is xi. In the original definition, the combat power x of the special force composed of soldiers {i, i+1, ..., i+k} was calculated as the sum of the combat powers of each soldier, meaning x = xi + xi+1 + ... + xk.\n\nHowever, through various glorious victories, it was concluded that the combat power of the special forces should be adjusted as follows: The adjusted combat power x' of the special force is calculated using the equation x' = ax^2 + bx + c. Here, a, b, and c are known coefficients with a<0, and x is the originally defined combat power of the special force.\n\nYour task is to divide the soldiers into special forces in order to maximize the sum of the adjusted combat powers of all special forces.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 4 soldiers with combat powers x1 = 2, x2 = 2, x3 = 3, and x4 = 4.

Just Generate True or False.\nDescription:\nThere is a commander in a military unit consisting of n soldiers numbered from 1 to n. The commander wants to divide the n soldiers into multiple special forces for future battles. To increase cohesion and morale, each special force is composed of consecutive soldiers with numbers in the form of {i, i+1, ..., i+k}.\n\nThe combat power of each soldier i is xi. In the original definition, the combat power x of the special force composed of soldiers {i, i+1, ..., i+k} was calculated as the sum of the combat powers of each soldier, meaning x = xi + xi+1 + ... + xk.\n\nHowever, through various glorious victories, it was concluded that the combat power of the special forces should be adjusted as follows: The adjusted combat power x' of the special force is calculated using the equation x' = ax^2 + bx + c. Here, a, b, and c are known coefficients with a<0, and x is the originally defined combat power of the special force.\n\nYour task is to divide the soldiers into special forces in order to maximize the sum of the adjusted combat powers of all special forces.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 4 soldiers with combat powers x1 = 2, x2 = 2, x3 = 3, and x4 = 4. Let the coefficients in the equation for the adjusted combat powers be a=-1, b=10, and c=-20. In this case, the optimal solution is to divide the soldiers into the following three special forces: the first special force consisting of soldiers 1 and 2, the second special force consisting of soldier 3, and the third special force consisting of soldier 4. The original combat powers of these three special forces are 4, 3, and 4 respectively, and the adjusted combat powers are 4, 1, and 4 respectively.

The government granted him a logging permit for the trees in a line near Sang-geun's house, and he will acquire the wood using his newly purchased log cutter.\nThe log cutter operates as follows. First, Sang-geun needs to specify the height H for the cutter. When the height is specified, the saw blade rises H meters above the ground. Then, it cuts down all the trees in a row. Therefore, the part of the tree above height H will be cut off for trees taller than H, and the shorter trees will not be cut. For example, let's say the heights of the trees in a row are 20, 15, 10, and 17. If Sang-geun specifies a height of 15, the heights of the trees after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15, and Sang-geun will take the 5-meter and 2-meter long trees home. (Total 7 meters will be taken home) The height that can be set on the cutter is a positive integer or 0.\nSince Sang-geun is very concerned about the environment, he wants to bring home only the necessary amount of wood.

True means the feedback is correct, and False means the feedback is incorrect. Just Generate True or False.\nDescription:\nSang-geun needs M meters of wood. Since all the places nearby to purchase wood have closed down, he requested a logging permit from the government. The government granted him a logging permit for the trees in a line near Sang-geun's house, and he will acquire the wood using his newly purchased log cutter.\nThe log cutter operates as follows. First, Sang-geun needs to specify the height H for the cutter. When the height is specified, the saw blade rises H meters above the ground. Then, it cuts down all the trees in a row. Therefore, the part of the tree above height H will be cut off for trees taller than H, and the shorter trees will not be cut. For example, let's say the heights of the trees in a row are 20, 15, 10, and 17. If Sang-geun specifies a height of 15, the heights of the trees after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15, and Sang-geun will take the 5-meter and 2-meter long trees home. (Total 7 meters will be taken home) The height that can be set on the cutter is a positive integer or 0.\nSince Sang-geun is very concerned about the environment, he wants to bring home only the necessary amount of wood. In this case, write a program to find the maximum value of the height that can be set on the cutter in order to bring at least M meters of wood home.\n - output format: Print the maximum height that can be set on the chainsaw in order to bring home at least M meters of wood.\n - input format: The first line contains two integers N and M, which represent the number of trees and the length of the tree that Sang-geun wants to take home, respectively. (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1,000,000, 1 \u2264 M \u2264 2,000,000,000)\nThe second line contains the height of the trees. The sum of the tree heights is always greater than or equal to M, so Sang-geun can always bring home the necessary trees. The height is a non-negative integer or 0, and it is less than or equal to 1,000,000,000.\nIncorrect code:\n```python\ntemp = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntree = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn, m = temp[0], temp[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef bubble_sort(list):\n    unsorted_until_index = len(list) - 1\n    sorted = False\n    while not sorted:\n        sorted = True\n        for i in range(unsorted_until_index):\n            if list[i] > list[i + 1]:\n                list[i], list[i + 1] = list[i + 1], list[i]\n                sorted = False\n        unsorted_until_index -= 1\n    \n    return list\n\n\ntree.sort()\nmax_cut = 0\nlower_bound = tree[n - 1] - m\nupper_bound = tree[n - 1]\nwhile lower_bound <= upper_bound:\n    mid = int((lower_bound + upper_bound) / 2)\n\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        rest = tree[i] - mid\n        if rest >= 0:\n            sum += rest\n\n    if sum >= m:\n        max_cut = mid\n        lower_bound += 1\n    else:\n        upper_bound -= 1\nprint(max_cut)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nFeedback:The logic in your binary search is incorrect, as you need to find the first index in the sorted list where the value is greater than the negative value, rather than finding the first index where the value is greater than or equal to the negative value.\n\nIs_Correct_Feedback:",
