(1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 45,000)\n  -output format: From the first line to the Tth line, output the least common multiple of A and B in the order in which they were inputted, one per line.\nIncorrect code:\n'''python\nn=int(input())\nnl = list(map(int,input().split()))\nre = max(nl)\nl = [nl[0]]\nfor i in range(1,n):\n    if l[-1]+nl[i]>0:\n        l.append(l[-1]+nl[i])\n    else:\n        l.append(0)\nprint(min(re,l))\n'''\nFeedback: Your current logic is incorrect because you are finding the minimum of the maximum value in the list and the list itself, instead of finding the least common multiple of A and B.

In order to maintain a pleasant environment in the barn, John divided the barn into M cells and planned to have only one cow in each cell.\nIn the first week, he operated the barn by randomly assigning cows to cells, but soon a problem arose. Some cows refused to enter cells other than the ones they preferred.\nHelp Farmer John write a program to maximize the number of cows that can enter the barn. The barn cells are numbered from 1 to M.\n - output format: Output the maximum number of cows that can enter the barn on the first line.\n - input format: The number of cows N and the number of barns M are given on the first line. (1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 200)\nFrom the second line onwards, the information about the barns that each cow wants to enter is given. The number of barns that the i-th cow wants to enter, Si (0 \u2264 Si \u2264 M), is given first, followed by Si barn numbers.

In this game, two strings S and T are given, and the goal is to convert S into T. There are only two possible operations to change a string:\n\n- Replace one character in S with any other character.\n- Remove any one character in S.\n\nWrite a program to determine whether it is possible to transform S into T using the given conditions.\n - output format: Print 1 if it is possible to change S to T, otherwise print 0.\n - input format: The first line consists of a string S, and the second line consists of a string T. \n(1 \u2264 length of S \u2264 49, 2 \u2264 length of T \u2264 50, length of S < length of T)\nIncorrect code:\n```python\n\n\n\n\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ns=sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nt=sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncounter=Counter(t)\n\nna=counter['A']\nnb=counter['B']\n\nqueue=deque()\nqueue.append(s)\nwhile queue:\n    cur=queue.popleft()\n    if len(cur)>len(t):\n        print(0)\n        break\n\n    cur_counter=Counter(cur)\n    cur_na=cur_counter['A']\n    cur_nb=cur_counter['B']\n\n    \n    if cur_na+1<=na:\n        appendA = cur + 'A'\n        if appendA == t:\n            print(1)\n            break\n        else:\n            queue.append(appendA)\n\n    \n    \n    if cur_nb+1<=nb:\n        appendB = cur + 'B'\n        if appendB[::-1] == t:\n            print(1)\n            break\n        else:\n            queue.append(appendB[::-1])\nelse:\n    print(0)\n```\nFeedback:Feedback for Refining the Code: \n1.
